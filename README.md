# Portfolio-Projects-in-SQL

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases various SQL-based projects focused on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. These projects highlight my ability to work with real-world datasets, write efficient SQL queries, and extract valuable insights using SQL best practices.

📊 Projects Included:

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this repository:

🔹 [Nashville_Housing_Data](https://github.com/tafafa/Portfolio-Projects-in-SQL/blob/5692c99c5680319e00709ba2d1e3cedf32fd968f/nashville_housing_data_cleaning/csv/nashville_housing_data.csv)

Each project contains a detailed explanation of the dataset, SQL queries used, and insights derived.

🛠️ SQL Skills & Techniques Used:

In these projects, I utilize a variety of SQL techniques to clean, transform, and analyze data effectively:

📌 Data Cleaning Techniques:

🛑 Why Clean Data?

- Real-world datasets often contain errors, inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate records.
- Cleaning data ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability in analysis.
- Without proper cleaning, insights can be misleading and lead to poor decision-making.

🛠 SQL Functions Used for Cleaning:

✅ TRIM() – Removes unnecessary spaces from text data to standardize values.

✅ SUBSTRING() – Extracts specific portions of text (e.g., separating city names from addresses).

✅ REPLACE() – Fixes inconsistencies in text, such as changing "NYC" to "New York".

✅ UPPER()/LOWER() – Standardizes case formatting in text columns.

✅ COALESCE() – Handles missing values by replacing NULL with meaningful defaults.

✅ CAST()/CONVERT() – Ensures proper data types for numerical and date values.

📌 Data Transformation & Analysis Techniques:

✅ Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) – Combining multiple tables for a complete view of data.

✅ Aggregations (COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()) – Summarizing key metrics.

✅ Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LAG(), LEAD()) – Generating rankings and trends over time.

✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Subqueries – Writing cleaner and more readable queries.

✅ Indexes & Performance Optimization – Enhancing query execution speed for large datasets.
